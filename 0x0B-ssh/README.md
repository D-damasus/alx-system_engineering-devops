# 0x0B - SSH

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What is a server
* Where servers usually live
* What is SSH
* How to create an SSH RSA key pair
* How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
* The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`
